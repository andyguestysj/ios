### Where Next?

Here are some additions for you to try  

#### Multiple Lives

Can you give the player three lives? You'll need to display the lives count somewhere on screen and have the player lose lives with each crash. The game doesn't restart until all lives are lost.  

#### Bonus Point Pickups

Can you add a new kind of object that comes in from the right like cars do but is worth points if the player manages to pick them up (by colliding with them)?

#### High Score Display

Can you keep track of the current high score and display it on the game over screen? You may need to make the game over screen last longer to see it clearly.
