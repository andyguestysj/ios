## First SpriteKit App

1. Launch XCode (white square with a blue hammer)
2. Follow tutorial at (https://www.appcoda.com/spritekit-introduction/)
   1. When asked to create a new project, select the dropdown for Organization Name and enter your AppleID.
   2. After the project is created you'll get an error about source control failing. Click the fix it button and enter your name and email address on the window that pops up, then close it.
3. When you've finished this, do the follow on tutorial (https://www.appcoda.com/spritekit-action-sequence/)
   1. when it tells you to add `func tap(recognizer: UIGestureRecognizer) {` instead add `@objc func tap(recognizer: UIGestureRecognizer) {` (Swift has changed a little since the tutorial was created)
4. When you have finished, remember to logout of the virtual machine before closing the connection.
