## Assessment

1. A One Page game description/promo/elevator pitch for your game [25%]
2. An IOS Game [75%]


For this module you will develop an IOS Game.  

(your choice or I tell you?)

### A One Page game description/promo/elevator pitch for your game [25%]

A One Page is a one page long document which shows the main features of your project and will let us stand out from the competition. It should be a brief, attractive and effective promotion for your game. It is used to “sell” the game concept to your team, your employers (if you work for a games company) or a games company/publisher if you are trying to find backing for your game.

There is a guide to creating One Pages (https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/how-to-design-your-one-page) and a gallery of one pages to inspire you (https://onepagelove.com/inspiration/game).

Your One Page should be a single page PDF file. It can be portrait or landscape layout. How you layout the page and exactly what you put on it is up to you but it should give a good overview of the game. Anyone looking at it should quickly grasp the game concept, its core loop, and its genre/theme.

### An IOS Game [75%]

A game developed for IOS. You have free rein to choose/I tell you which game.  

It should be developed using the MacinCloud service so it can be demonstrated in class. You will need to demonstrate your game and discuss it as part of the assessment.
