## MacinCloud

We do not have modern Mac machines to work on so we will be using a Cloud service called MacinCloud that hosts virtual Mac machines we can connect to.  

You will each be emailed the details of the account you can use for this module. The email will give you a username and password for your account. It will also contain a zip file containing connection files for warious screen resolutions and instructions for connecting to the Virtual Mac. To connect from Linux use remmina instead of the tool advised in the zip file.  

### Apple ID

To fully use the XCode software you will need an AppleID.  

If you don't already have an Apple ID you can create one here (https://appleid.apple.com/account).

### Connecting to the Virtual Mac

**GETTING STARTED**

1. How to connect to the server.

Please download MacinCloud Connection Files by clicking the "Connection File" links above in the account table.
•	For Windows PC users - You do not need to install any additional software if you are accessing from a Windows PC computer. Simply double-click the MacinCloud connection file mentioned above to connect, and then login using the provided server username and password. If you are not familiar with the process, please view our Tutorial Video.
•	For Mac users - Please first install Microsoft Remote Desktop App through the App Store by clicking HERE. For Mac users who have earlier Mac OS (10.8 or earlier), you can download and install a legacy version of this app by clicking HERE. After installing the remote desktop app, simply double-click the MacinCloud connection file mentioned above to connect, and then login using the provided username and password.
•	For Linux users - Use remmina to connect to the server using the details sent to you. You need to include the port number (port 6000) in the server name field (i.e. [hostname]:6000).
•	For all desktop users - In addition to the connection files, you may simply use your browser to connect to your server. Please login to the User Portal at portal.macincloud.com with your account email and select the "Action" menu next to your managed server name to connect.
•	For mobile device users - You may access your server from iPhone, iPad and other mobile phone or devices (feature limitations may apply). Please follow this guide or visit our Knowledge Base for further instructions.

2. Utilize the User Portal at portal.macincloud.com. 

The User Portal is a great tool for you to update your account information and manage your service.

After logging in to the User Portal with your account email, you will have access to many features allowing you to manage and update your service account. Please make sure to login using the same email you used during sign up.

Here are the main features included in the portal:
•	Billing information update. You can update your billing information through the billing section.
•	Use your browser to connect to your server. The "Action" menu next to your managed server name allow you to instantly connect to your server without additional software tools.
•	Update and purchase more accounts. You can utilize the portal to update existing servers and purchase more server accounts.

3. Make sure to log off your Mac server account properly after you complete your usage.

You must log off your Mac server account from the Apple icon menu to end each usage session.
