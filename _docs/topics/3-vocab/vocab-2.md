Leaving aside the problem of a definition of what games are, we can identify features which are common in games. A game need not contain all the features and not everything with one or more of these features will be a game, but the list is useful.  

* Games are an **activity**.
* Games have **rules**.
* Games have **conflict**.
* Games have **goals**.
* Games involve **decision making**.
* Games are **artificial**, they are **safe**, and they are **outside ordinary life**. This is sometimes referred to as the players stepping into the “Magic Circle” or sharing a “lusory attitude”.
* Games involve **no material gain** on the part of the players.
* Games have an **uncertain outcome**.
* Games are a **representation** or **simulation** of something real, but they are themselves **make believe**.
* Games are **voluntary.** If you are held at gunpoint and forced into an activity that would normally be considered a game, some would say that it is no longer a game for you. (Something to think about: if you accept this, then an activity that is voluntary for some players and compulsory for others may or may not be a game… depending on whose point of view you are looking at.)
* Games are **inefficient**. The rules impose obstacles that prevent the player from reaching their goal through the most efficient means.
* Games have **systems**. Usually, it is a **closed** system, meaning that resources and information do not flow between the game and the outside world.
* Games are a form of **art**.
