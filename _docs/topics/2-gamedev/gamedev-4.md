The **beat chart** is a tool that can not only help you develop the content of your GDD, but also provides a "map" of the structure of your game; this is extremely important when examining the gameplay progression. Every beat chart requires the following elements:

* Level/environment name
* File name (level/environment designation)
* Time of day (in context of the game)
* Story elements for level
* Progression: gameplay focus of the level
* Estimated play time of level
* Color scheme of level/environment
* Enemies/bosses introduced and used
* Mechanics introduced and used
* Hazards introduced and used
* Power-ups found in level/environment
* New abilities, weapons, or gear introduced/unlocked
* Treasure amount and type the player can find
* Bonus material found in level/environment
* Music track(s) to be used in this level/environment.
