## Mechanics, Dynamics and Aesthetics

The MDA framework was proposed in "MDA: A Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research" by Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc and Robert Zubeck (2004). ([Available here](../MDA.pdf))  

### Elements of MDA

MDA considers games using three elements.  

* **Mechanics** - The particular components of the game at the level of data representation and algorithms.
* **Dynamics** - The runtime behaviour of the mechanics acting on player inputs and each other's outputs over time. 
* **Aesthetics** - The desirable emotional responses evoked in the player when they interact with the game system.

### Viewpoints

MDA proposes that designers and players view games from different directions.

**Designers** should first consider the *aesthetic* feelings that they want players to experience, then consider the *dynamic play* that will engender these *aesthetics*. Finally they create *mechanics* that will lead to these *dynamics*.  
**Players** first read the rules of the game (*mechanics*), these rules lead to *dynamic play*, the dynamics engender *aesthetic* feelings.
