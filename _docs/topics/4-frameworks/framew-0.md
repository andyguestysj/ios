A number of analytical frameworks for games have been proposed. These frameworks are intended to help understand and discuss the structure and fundamentals elements of games and the the impact of games on players and society.  

Frameworks do not define what a game *is*. Frameworks are an approach to understanding and and analysing the elements that are needed to make a game and the dynamic behaviour of those elements during play.  

## Frameworks Covered

* MDA
* Formal, Dramatic, and Dynamic Elements
* Elemental Tetrad
* Layered Tetrad
