Each framework has a different perspective

* **MDA** demonstrates that gamers and designers approach games from different directions
  * Encourages designers to see games from the perspective of players
* **Formal, Dramatic, & Dynamic** breaks games down into specific components that can be isolated, tweaked, and improved
* **Elemental Tetrad** views games from the perspective of a development studio

The **Layered Elemental Tetrad** is a combination and extension of these frameworks.
